Tam For Dummies
===============

This is a capstone project developed during the Web Developer Bootcamp at CodeCore (Vancouver, BC).
It is a solution to live capture CodeCore's lectures (instructed by Tam Kabeili), record, organize and store them in a private Youtube channel, making them available for revisiting and playbacks.

The solution includes features like: 
* screen mirroring & capturing (AirPlay & WebRTC)
* video streaming (OpenMax, Gstreamer & Youtube Live Streaming API)
* client-side programming & notes' editing (Javascript, jQuery, AJAX, JSON)
* videos' catalog & presentation (JSON & Timeline.js)
* animations & iOS devices integration (CSS3, HTML5 & React Native)
* background jobs (Java)
* Linux and Bash programming (Raspberry PI)
